    "ONF's 8th mini album title song 'Bye My Monster' is a pop dance song with a classic atmosphere and strong band sound. The grand narrative was further maximized by quoting the theme from Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2, III. Adagio. Each member's long, intertwined lyrics complete a story, and the lyrical yet powerful vocals, rap, and harmony blend seamlessly to increase dramatic immersion.",
